# cs2-chat-translator
A chat translator for CS:2 in python.  

This script constantly reads the console.log file, finds the chat messages,  
translates them using the translator of your choice (google, bing, ...) and prints them in the python terminal. 

This script does not inject anything and does not read the game memory to get the messages,  
it uses the "condebug" feature which is intended by the game. There is no risk in using it.

## Usage
1) pip install translators
2) Add the "-condebug" startup argument to CS:2.
3) Download, configure and run the script.

If you encounter an issue,  make sure you have downloaded the .py (not copy and paste).
